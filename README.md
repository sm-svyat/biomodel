Computer model of electronic transport in chloroplasts.

Here is a demo version of the model of the electronic transport chain in chloroplasts.

This model was modernized and transferred to the Python language.

A detailed description of the main version of the model can be found in the article "Modeling of Electron and Proton Transport in Chloroplast Membranes with Regard to Thioredoxin-Dependent Activation of the Calvinâ€“Benson Cycle and ATP-Synthase". DOI: 10.7868/S0233475518020019
